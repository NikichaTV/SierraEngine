# What is Sierra Engine?

An **open-source** game/rendering engine, which aims to provide users with an all-in-one development kit, suited for any graphics-intensive tasks (such as video games, 3D editors, etc.). It is based solely on the **[Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)** rendering API, which provides support for **Windows 7-11**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **Android**, **iOS**, and **[more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan#Cross_platform)**, but is planned to also feature native APIs (like **[DirectX](https://developer.nvidia.com/directx)** and **[Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/)**) to further improve its already-incredible performance

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Building and Running the Engine

**Compatible compilers:**

These are the compilers, which are tested and confirmed to be able to build the project. Some other compilers may still be used, though there could be issues.

* [![MSVC Compiler Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/MSVC-2019\/2022-blue.svg)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
* [![Clang LLVM Compiler Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Clang-LLVM-blue.svg)](https://clang.llvm.org/)
* [![Clang Apple Compiler Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Clang-Apple-blue.svg)](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [![GCC Compiler Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/GCC-Unix-blue.svg)](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

<br>

**Requirements:**

In order to build it, you first must make sure you have the following installed (some of these modules may come with your IDE of choice):

<br>

* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**
* A C/C++ compiler (preferably **[CLang](https://clang.llvm.org)** or **[MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)**)
* **[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)** 3.20 or higher
* **[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)** build tool
* The **[VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com)**
* **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**

<br>

**Installation:**

Simply clone the repository either directly from your favourite IDE (<b><a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com">Visual Studio</a></b>, <b><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a></b>, etc.), or by opening the command line and running:

```bat
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/NikichaTV/SierraEngine
```

<br>

If you clone the repository directly from an IDE, you may need to also run this:

```bat
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

And there you have it! You can now play around with the engine itself or create your very own application.

## ü§ìÔ∏è About

**Frameworks used:**

* [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm/) - Provides the engine with a powerful set of tools for solving linear algebra problems.
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) - Used for fast, asynchronous debug-only logging.
* [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) - Allows for incredibly fast rendering on a wide variety of platforms.
* [Volk](https://github.com/zeux/volk/tree/master/) - A tool to further optimize [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)'s CPU overhead.
* [Glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) - Dynamic loader for OpenGL.
* [VMA](https://gpuopen.com/vulkan-memory-allocator/) - For optimal memory management of [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) objects.
* [ios-cmake](https://github.com/leetal/ios-cmake) - Essential for building the engine on iOS.
* [Better Enum](https://github.com/aantron/better-enums) - Compile-time reflected enums.
* [My Brain](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.528192883.5730/st,small,845x845-pad,1000x1000,f8f8f8.u9.jpg) - There is not much left of it, actually...

<br>

**Software used:**

* [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) - Primary IDE of the project.
* [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) - Another IDE which was used to create the .NET 6.0 prototype version of the engine.
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Used to deploy the iOS version on mobile [Apple](https://www.apple.com) devices.
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - Managing and testing 3D models.
* [Trello](https://trello.com/b/RMYtZPOg/sierra-engine/) - For pretending to have an organized list of things to implement next.
