<p>
A little <strong>open-source</strong> game engine, written in C# (.NET 6.0), which features some of the most common game programming techniques built-in. 
It is based on the <b><a href="https://www.vulkan.org/">Vulkan</a></b> rendering API, which provides support for 
<b>Windows 7-11</b>, <b>macOS</b>, <b>Linux</b>, <b>Android</b>, <b>iOS</b>, <b>tvOS</b> and other operating systems,
though the engine has only been tested on <b>Windows 10, 11</b> and <b>macOS Monterey</b>. All of its features are listed below.

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Installing, Building, and Running the Engine<br>

Clone the repository in your IDE of choice (<i>Visual Studio</i>, <i>Rider</i>, etc.) Now, you will have to run a Python script what will configure the project for you. Obviously, this will require your machine to have <b><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a></b> installed, so make sure you have that. Navigate over to the folder where you cloned the repo and run the following two commands in your command prompt or terminal:
```bat
$ cd Scripts/
$ python3 UpdateProject.py --Release
```

You can then proceed and run the program in your IDE. Make sure you are in <b>RELEASE</b> mode, because Debug mode will not be configured by the script. However, if you are feeling like working on the project yourself, feel free to change the <i>--Release</i> argument with <i>--Debug</i>, which will configure it for Debug mode.
